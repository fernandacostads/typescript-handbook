# TypeScript Handbook

The code examples and topics in this handbook are gathered from various sources to learn TypeScript in more detail.

## Glossary:

- tsc = TypeScript CLI
- TS = TypeScript
- WBAS = will be added soon (as I progress with my learning goals)

## What is TypeScript?

From their official website:

`TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.`

_**This is actually correct**. I cannot define all the features it offers without you (yourself) exploring it in depth._

## Pros & Cons

These are the first few things comes to my mind when I think about TS.

Pros:

- Type checking
- OOP
- Best of both worlds (front end and back end)
- Can be use with most of the latest JS frameworks/libraries.
- Amazingly superb with growing source code.
- ES6 features? Indeed TS supports all those new features.

Cons:

- A bit of hassle in integration (tho latest tools offer TS integration out of the box).
- Can increase development time if not being used with proper type structuring approach.

## Sources:

All the sources (now and in future) will be added here.
