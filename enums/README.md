Enums
====

Types
----

- Numeric enums
- String enums
- Heterogeneous enums

    Technically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members, but itâ€™s not clear why you would ever want to do so:


**Computed and constant members**

- Constant value assigned at initialize time = constant member
- Value assigned after a computation (etc function call) = computed member

// will be added later
